compat: Make plugin compatible with GLPI 11 and fix DB/raw SQL issues

Summary
- Bump compatibility for GLPI 11 (setup.php).
- Replace direct DB->query with safe DB API calls; avoid building/executing raw SQL in the DB iterator.
- Use utf8mb4 collations and adjust ID fields to `INT UNSIGNED` where appropriate.
- Harden `makeProtocol()` to validate POST input and avoid inserting NULL `items_id`.
- Replace raw SELECT used by the item iterator with structured `DB->request()` criteria.
- Add tests: `tests/run_makeprotocol.php` (CLI) and `tests/run_web_makeprotocol.php` (web integration).

Testing performed
- Installed and activated the plugin on GLPI 11 in this environment.
- Ran `php -l` for syntax checks.
- Executed `tests/run_makeprotocol.php` to produce a PDF and glpi DB entries.
- Executed `tests/run_web_makeprotocol.php` (logs in, posts the form, verifies the document->item link).
- Verified `files/_log/php-errors.log` no longer contains the `DBmysqlIterator::execute()` raw-query critical exception.

Notes for reviewers
- The branch `compat/glpi-11` contains all commits and tests.
- Manual UI verification: open a User form and the Protocols Manager tab, create a protocol and confirm the PDF is attached and linked to selected items.
- I can open the PR from your fork if you prefer; otherwise follow the instructions in `pr_instructions.txt` to push and create the PR.
