Instructions to push branch and open PR

1. Add your fork remote (if not already added):
   git remote add fork https://github.com/jpnr79/protocolsmanager.git

2. Push the branch:
   git push -u fork compat/glpi-11

3. Open a Pull Request on GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/jpnr79/protocolsmanager/compare
   - Select `compat/glpi-11` as the branch to compare and create a PR targeting the upstream repository `CanMik/protocolsmanager` main branch.
   - Use the contents of `pr_body.txt` as the PR description.

Alternatively, using GitHub CLI (if installed):
   gh repo fork --clone=false
   git push -u fork compat/glpi-11
   gh pr create --base CanMik:main --head jpnr79:compat/glpi-11 --title "compat: Make plugin compatible with GLPI 11" --body-file pr_body.txt
